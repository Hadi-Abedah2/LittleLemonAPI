        <h1>Welcome to my LittleLemonAPI project.</h1>
        <p>You may find additional files,folders and configurations in my project. An example of this includes the <span class="highlight">scripts</span> folder, as I utilized the <span class="highlight">django-extensions</span> package to populate the <span class="highlight">menu-item</span> table directly from a CSV file.</p>
        <p>Another example is some additional code to my <span class="highlight">models.py</span>  so that the <span class="highlight-soft">total</span> field for each order and the <span class="highlight-soft">price</span> field in carts are calculated based on the <span class="highlight-soft"> price </span> field provided first in the <span class="highlight">MenuItem</span>  table and the quantity demanded for each menu item in the cart.</p>
        <p>I also played around in <span class="highlight">admins.py</span>  to customize the look and options of <span class="highlight">User</span> and <span class="highlight">MenuItem</span> models in the admin control panel so that nobody can adjust the date of last login or the date of first login , and menu items in the <span class="highlight">MenuItem</span> model are now ordered by price and could be searched for using their titles.</p>
        <p><span style="color: red;">Please note</span> that this isn't my first submission. I passed the assignment about 6 months ago and my code was much simpler back then. This time, I aim to achieve a higher grade and compare myself with the only one I should compare myself to an <span color="Red"> <italic > "older" me </italic> </span>.</p>
        <p>For details on tokens,usernames and thier roles, please refer to the <span class="highlight">README.md</span> file.</p>
        <p>Good luck to all of us!!</p>
